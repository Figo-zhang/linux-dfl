Description:	Read-only. This file returns a space separated list of

Date:		Aug 2022
KernelVersion:  6.0
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Write-only. A key word may be written to this file to
		trigger a reload of an FPGA, BMC, or firmware image from
		FLASH or EEPROM. Refer to the available_images file for a
		list of supported key words for the underlying device.
		Writing an unsupported string to this file will result in
		EINVAL being returned.
		It should remove all of resources related to the old FPGA/BMC
		image before trigger the image reload otherwise the functionality
		of FPGA/BMC will fail. We recommended that follow the below steps
		or directly use the OPAE RSU script to perform the reload for FPGA/BMC
		image.
		Here is the steps to trigger the reload for FPGA/BMC image:
		1. Unbind driver from all VFs to be affected by the trigger.
		2. Disable all VFs via "/sys/bus/pic/device/xxxx/sriov_numvfs"
		sysfs file.
		3. Unbind driver from all PFs affectected by the trigger except the
		management PF.
		4. Disable AER on all PFs and upstream pci root port.
		5. Trigger image reload of FPGA and/or other programmable devices.
	        6. Hot-remove the PCI devices of the FPGA card via
		"/sys/bus/pci/devices/xxxx/remove" sysfs file.
		7. Wait for reconfiguration of FPGA an/or other programmable parts
		(e.g. 10 seconds)
		8. Re-scan PCI bus.
		9. Renable the AER on all PFs and upstream root port.
		10. Bring up VFs as desired.
